There are over 50,000 pubs in the UK and thousands of the names reference humans or animals from *George and Dragon (6 points 🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏🏏)* to *The Red Lion (4 points 🏏🏏🏏🏏)* to *The Magpie Inn (2 points 🏏🏏)*.

Dot density challenge 1: 

Display the number of pubs across the UK. Upload the data, add it to a style, and adjust the radius size to 1 px. Users will see that pubs are sprinkled throughout the region but have dense concentrations in cities such as London and Nottingham.

Dot density challenge 2: 

Filter the data by 'points' removing points that are equal to 0. Then color the circles by potential points earned: 2, 4, 6, 8 - try moving the road network higher up in the layer stack to show the points that fall along major roadways.
